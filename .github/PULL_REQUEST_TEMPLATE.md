Please read and remove:

Practically all PRs are non-mergeable because they conflict with each other, and
continually asking for rebases would be impractical.

Because of that, it is likely that your signature is going to be added via a
commit rather than a regular merge, in which case the commit is referenced in
the notification email and in the page of the PR itself. I have a supervised
script that processes the patches and commits valid signatures referencing the
PR for credit and authenticity.
